# Horror Movie and Political Climate Analysis

This project analyzes popular horror movies across various decades to explore how their themes reflect and respond to political environments. 

# Problem Description

In contemporary discourse, there is often a disconnect between popular culture, particularly film, and the sociopolitical issues that shape society. While horror movies have been a staple of American cinema, their potential as a lens for understanding historical and political contexts is frequently overlooked. This project seeks to address the gap in research that explores how horror films not only reflect societal fears and anxieties but also engage with the political climate of their time.
