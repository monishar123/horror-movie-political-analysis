# Horror Movies and Political Climate Analysis

## Project Overview
This project analyzes popular horror movies to explore how they reflect or respond to the political environment of their respective decades. By examining the themes, plots, and societal anxieties presented in these films, the project draws connections between the horror genre and the sociopolitical context of the times.

## Features
- **Data Collection**: Gather horror movies by decade, including titles, release years, box office performance, and critical reception.
- **Analysis**: Examine political events or movements occurring during each film's release decade.
- **Visualization**: Highlight correlations between horror film themes and political climates through charts and graphs.
- **Interactive Dashboard**: Allow users to explore data by decade or political event.
