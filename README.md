# horror-movie-political-analysis
This project aims to analyze popular horror movies and explore how they reflect or respond to the political environment of their respective decades. By examining the themes, plots, and societal anxieties presented in these films, the project will draw connections between the horror genre and the sociopolitical context of the times.
Features:

•	Data collection of horror movies by decade, including titles, release years, box office performance, and critical reception.
•	Analysis of political events or movements occurring during the decade of each film’s release.
•	Visualization of trends showing correlations between horror film themes and political climates.
•	Interactive dashboard allowing users to explore data by decade or political event.

Tools and Technologies:

•	Programming Language: Python (for data analysis and visualization)
•	Libraries:
o	Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
o	Matplotlib/Seaborn: For data visualization.
o	Beautiful Soup/Scrapy: For web scraping movie data (if necessary).
•	APIs:
o	IMDb API: To gather movie-related data (e.g., genre, ratings).
o	Political Event Databases: APIs or datasets that document political events (e.g., US government archives, Wikipedia).
•	Data Storage: SQLite or CSV files for storing collected datasets.

Integration Plan:

1.	Collect horror movie data and political event data.
2.	Clean and preprocess the data to ensure consistency and accuracy.
3.	Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover patterns.
4.	Create visualizations to highlight findings.
5.	Develop an interactive dashboard to present the analysis.
   
Problem Description

•	In contemporary discourse, there is often a disconnect between popular culture, particularly film, and the sociopolitical issues that shape society. While horror movies have been a staple of American cinema, their potential as a lens for understanding historical and political contexts is frequently overlooked. This project seeks to address the gap in research that explores how horror films not only reflect societal fears and anxieties but also engage with the political climate of their time.

Opportunity

•	By analyzing the themes and narratives of popular horror movies across different decades, this project leverages the opportunity to illuminate the complex relationship between film and politics. It aims to provide a deeper understanding of how horror films can serve as cultural commentaries, revealing societal concerns and influencing public perception. This exploration can foster greater appreciation for the horror genre as a significant medium for social critique and historical reflection.

Goal 1: Primary Goal

To analyze popular horror movies from various decades to understand how their themes, narratives, and societal anxieties reflect and respond to the political environment of their respective times. This will involve identifying key films that exemplify these connections and drawing conclusions about the horror genre’s role as a cultural commentary.

Goal 2: Additional Goals/Objectives

1.	Identify Patterns: Examine recurring themes and motifs within horror films across different decades, linking them to significant political events and societal changes.
2.	Cultural Analysis: Investigate how horror films portray marginalized groups and address social justice issues, highlighting the genre's evolution in response to shifting societal attitudes.
3.	Create a Visual Representation: Develop a timeline or visual aid that maps the release of notable horror films against major political events to illustrate correlations between film and political climate.
4.	Engage with Audiences: Present findings through a well-structured report or presentation that invites discussion about the implications of horror films in reflecting societal fears and the political landscape.

Evaluation Methods

1.	Testing Methods
   
o	Unit Testing: Implement unit tests for individual components of your code to ensure they function as intended. This helps catch issues early in the development process.
o	Integration Testing: Conduct integration tests to verify that different modules of your project work together seamlessly. This is particularly important for data handling and processing components.
o	User Acceptance Testing (UAT): Before the final rollout, have a group of end-users test the application. Gather their feedback on usability and functionality to make necessary adjustments.
2.	User Feedback

o	Surveys and Questionnaires: Distribute surveys to users after they interact with your application. Include questions on usability, design, and overall satisfaction to gather quantitative data.
o	Focus Groups: Organize focus groups to engage users in discussions about their experiences with the project. This qualitative feedback can provide deeper insights into user needs and preferences.
o	Interviews: Conduct one-on-one interviews with key stakeholders or users to gather detailed feedback about their expectations and experiences with the project.

3.	Performance Metrics

o	Usage Statistics: Track metrics such as the number of users, time spent on the application, and the number of completed tasks. This data can help gauge user engagement and overall interest in the project.
o	Error Rates: Monitor the frequency of errors or bugs encountered by users. A lower error rate generally indicates a more successful and user-friendly application.
o	Task Completion Rate: Measure how effectively users can complete tasks within the application. High completion rates suggest that the application is intuitive and meets user needs.
o	Load Times and Performance: Evaluate the application's performance in terms of loading times and response times. Optimizing these aspects is crucial for a positive user experience.

4.	Post-Launch Evaluation
o	Follow-Up Surveys: After a period of use, conduct follow-up surveys to assess the long-term impact of the project. This can help identify areas for improvement and gauge user retention.
o	Iterative Improvements: Based on user feedback and performance metrics, implement iterative improvements to enhance the application. Continuous evaluation will help maintain relevance and user satisfaction over time.

Conclusion

By combining these evaluation methods, you can gain a comprehensive understanding of your project's success and areas for improvement. Establishing clear evaluation criteria from the outset will also help you align your project goals with user expectations and needs.
